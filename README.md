This program scrapes news articles from a website and lets users save the articles and add notes with the articles.  It is a very fun and useful application.

The user is initially brought to the home screen when he opens the webpage.  This home screen is shown up above.
The user has a set of options presented to him from the nav bar.  The user can scrape the articles on the website and see an output of them.  The user can see all the articles that have previously been saved with the program.  

If the user scrapes the current articles from the website, a listing of the articles will appear with the title. link, and summary.  The user then has the option to select and save an article.  After a user scrapes the articles, he will be alerted of the number of articles scraped.  If an article has already been saved to the program, the article will not be listed.  

With the listing of the saved articless, the user has an option to write a note on an article and save it.  The user can also see the previous notes written for an article and delete the notes.
